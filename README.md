Pulls the record of a debate team from tabroom. 

The program accepts the debate team name as it is written on tabroom, such as “School Name AA”

This program only pulls results from the national circuit results (2016 and 2015), and it has only been tested with PF but would probably work with debate teams from LD and CX. 

Team names are NOT case sensitive, but they are very spelling-sensitive. The order of the initials does not matter. 

Sometimes, the name of the debate team on the pairings page may not match the full team name (ex. the tournament pairings page displays the school as “Colombia”, but the full school name is “Colombia University of New York”). In this case, the program just guesses, and picks the first school down the list. It works some of the time.
